## 🔢 Problem: [2418. Sort the People](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-people/)

### 🧩 Problem Statement:
You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array of integers `heights`, both of length `n`. Each `names[i]` is the name of the ith person, and `heights[i]` is the height of the ith person.

Return `names` sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

---

### ✅ Example:

Input:
```
names = ["Mary", "John", "Emma"]
heights = [180, 165, 170]
```

Output:
```
["Mary", "Emma", "John"]
```
🧠 Approach:
Pair each height with its corresponding index.

Sort the height-index pairs in descending order based on height.

Construct the result using the sorted indices to get names in the correct order.

📌 Java Solution
```
class Solution {
    public String[] sortPeople(String[] names, int[] heights) {
        int n = heights.length;
        int[][] arr = new int[n][2];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            arr[i] = new int[] {heights[i], i}; // Pair height with index
        }

        Arrays.sort(arr, (a, b) -> b[0] - a[0]); // Sort by height descending

        String[] ans = new String[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            ans[i] = names[arr[i][1]]; // Fetch names using sorted indices
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
