🔢 Problem 7: Reverse an Integer

📌 Problem Statement

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2³¹, 2³¹ - 1], then return 0.

📝 Example

✅ Input:
```
x = 123
```
✅ Output:
```
321
```
✅ Input:
```
x = -123
```
✅ Output:
```
-321
```
✅ Input:
```
x = 120
```
✅ Output:
```
21
```

💡 Approach

Initialize a variable ans of type long to store the reversed number.

Use a while loop to extract digits from x using modulo (% 10) and build ans by multiplying it by 10 and adding the extracted digit.

Continue this process until x becomes 0.

Check for overflow: If ans is out of the 32-bit integer range, return 0.

Otherwise, cast ans to int and return the result.

💻 Java Solution
```
class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        long ans=0;
        while (x!=0){
            ans= ans*10+x%10;
            x/=10;
        }
        return (ans<Integer.MIN_VALUE || ans>Integer.MAX_VALUE)? 0 :(int)ans;
    }
}
```
📊 Complexity Analysis

⏳ Time Complexity: O(log₁₀(n)), where n is the absolute value of x, since we process each digit.

🛠 Space Complexity: O(1), as we use only a few extra variables.

🔎 Key Takeaways

✅ Handles both positive and negative numbers correctly.✅ Uses long to detect overflow before returning the result.✅ Efficient and runs in logarithmic time.

🎯 Optimized for fast execution and memory efficiency! 🚀
