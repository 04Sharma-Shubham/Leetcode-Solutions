## 📘 Problem: 2769. Maximum Achievable Number

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Link:** [LeetCode - 2769](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-achievable-number/)

### 🧠 Problem Statement:

Given two integers `num` and `t`, the maximum achievable number `x` is defined as:  
Every second, you can either increment or decrement `x` by `1`. After `t` seconds, what's the maximum number you can reach starting from `num`?

**Formula:**  
Max Achievable Number = `num + 2 * t`

---

### ✅ Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int theMaximumAchievableX(int num, int t) {
        return num + (2 * t);
    }
}
```
🔍 Explanation:
Every second you can move +1 or -1.

In t seconds, you can go a maximum of +t and then mirror it back to +t again.

So total max addition to the number = 2 * t.
