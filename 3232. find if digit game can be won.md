# 🎮 LeetCode 3232: Find if Digit Game Can Be Won

## 📜 Problem Statement

In a **digit game**, two players, Alice and Bob, are given an array of integers `nums`.

Rules:
- **Alice** collects all numbers that are **single-digit** (i.e., numbers less than 10).
- **Bob** collects all numbers that are **double-digit** or greater (i.e., numbers ≥ 10).

To win:
- Alice wins if the **sum** of her numbers is **different** from Bob’s sum.
- If both sums are **equal**, she loses.

Return `true` if **Alice can win**, otherwise return `false`.
```

## 🧠 Example

### Example 1:
Input: nums = [2, 5, 13, 21] Output: true Explanation:

Alice's sum = 2 + 5 = 7

Bob's sum = 13 + 21 = 34

7 != 34 → Alice wins.
```
```

### Example 2:
Input: nums = [5, 15, 5, 15] Output: false Explanation:

Alice's sum = 5 + 5 = 10

Bob's sum = 15 + 15 = 30

10 != 30 → Alice wins.
```
```
### Example 3:
Input: nums = [9, 9, 18] Output: false Explanation:

Alice's sum = 9 + 9 = 18

Bob's sum = 18

18 == 18 → Alice loses.
```
```
---

## ✅ Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 99`

---
```
## 🧩 Approach

- Initialize two counters:
  - `a` → sum of numbers collected by Alice.
  - `b` → sum of numbers collected by Bob.
- Traverse the array:
  - If the number is `< 10`, add to Alice’s sum.
  - Otherwise, add to Bob’s sum.
- Finally, return `true` if the sums are **not equal**, else `false`.

## 💻 Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canAliceWin(int[] nums) {
        int a = 0, b = 0;
        for (int x : nums) {
            if (x < 10) {
                a += x;
            } else {
                b += x;
            }
        }
        return a != b;
    }
}
```
🏁 Dry Run Example
Input:

```
nums = [1, 2, 12, 3]
```
Steps:

Alice collects: 1, 2, 3 → sum = 6

Bob collects: 12 → sum = 12

Check:

6 != 12 → Alice wins! ✅
