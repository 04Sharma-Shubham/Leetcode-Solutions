## 🧩 Problem: 1827 - Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing

This repository includes clean and optimized Java solutions to LeetCode problems. Below is the solution for:

> **🔧 1827. Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing**

---

### 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of integers. You must perform operations to make the array strictly increasing.  
In one operation, you can increment any element by 1.  
Return the **minimum number of operations** required to make `nums` strictly increasing.

---

### 💡 Example

**Input:**

```text
nums = [1, 1, 1]
Output:
3
```

Explanation:
You can increment the second element once and the third element twice. Final array: [1, 2, 3].

🧠 Approach
Create a copy of the original array for reference.

Traverse the array and check each element with the next one.

If the next element is not greater than the current one, make it equal to current + 1 and track the number of operations.

Sum up all increments required and return the total.

🔍 Java Solution
```
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int arr[] = new int[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
            arr[i] = nums[i];
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]) {
                nums[i + 1] = nums[i] + 1;
                count += nums[i + 1] - arr[i + 1];
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
⏱️ Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) (for the copied array)
