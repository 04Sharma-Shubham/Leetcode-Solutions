## 🔢 Problem 561: Array Partition

> **Difficulty**: Easy  
> [🔗 View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/array-partition-i)

---

### 🧩 Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of `2n` integers, group these integers into `n` pairs such that the sum of the **minimum** of each pair is **maximized**.

You need to return the maximum possible sum of the minimum elements from each pair.

---

### 💡 Example

**Input:**  
`nums = [1, 4, 3, 2]`

**Output:**  
`4`

**Explanation:**  
Pair the numbers as (1, 2) and (3, 4).  
The sum of min(1,2) + min(3,4) = 1 + 3 = 4.

---

### ✅ Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
  public int arrayPairSum(int[] nums) {
    int ans = 0;

    Arrays.sort(nums); // Sort the array

    // Sum every alternate element (min of each pair)
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 2)
      ans += nums[i];

    return ans;
  }
}
```
🧠 Explanation
Sort the array in ascending order.

By always picking the first element of each pair after sorting, we ensure the minimum is maximized.

Add every alternate element starting from index 0.
