# 🧩 LeetCode - 1528. Shuffle String

## 💡 Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the same length.  
The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at the `i`<sup>th</sup> position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string.

**Return the shuffled string.**

---

### 🧪 Example:

**Input:**  
`s = "codeleet"`  
`indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]`  

**Output:**  
`"leetcode"`

---

## 🚀 Solution

We create a new character array `ans` of the same size as `s`, and then for every character in `s`, we place it at the target index specified by `indices[i]`. Finally, we return the string version of the character array.

### ✅ Java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public String restoreString(String s, int[] indices) {
        int n = s.length();
        char[] ans = new char[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            ans[indices[i]] = s.charAt(i);
        }
        return String.valueOf(ans);
    }
}
```
