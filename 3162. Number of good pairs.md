## 🔢 LeetCode Question 3162 - Number of Good Pairs

### 📝 Problem Statement

You are given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` and an integer `k`. A pair `(i, j)` is called a **good pair** if:

nums1[i] % (nums2[j] * k) == 0


Your task is to return the total number of **good pairs**.

### 📥 Example

**Input:**
```
nums1 = [3,1,4], nums2 = [1,2,4], k = 1

```

**Output:**
```
5
```


**Explanation:**
```
- Good pairs: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,2)
```
---

### ✅ Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfPairs(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int k) {
        int goodPair = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < nums2.length; j++) {
                if (nums1[i] % (nums2[j] * k) == 0) {
                    goodPair++;
                }
            }
        }
        return goodPair;
    }
}
```
🔍 Approach
Use two nested loops to iterate through all combinations of nums1[i] and nums2[j].

For each pair, check if the given modulo condition is satisfied.

If true, increment the count of good pairs.

⏱️ Time Complexity
O(n × m) – where n = nums1.length, m = nums2.length
