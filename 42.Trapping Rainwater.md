🚀 Problem #7: Trapping Rain Water

Problem Statement:
Given an array height representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example:
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) traps 6 units of rain water (blue section).
```
🔹 Optimized Java Solution
```
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length == 0) return 0;
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0, trappedWater = 0;
        
        while (left < right) {
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                if (height[left] >= leftMax) {
                    leftMax = height[left];
                } else {
                    trappedWater += leftMax - height[left];
                }
                left++;
            } else {
                if (height[right] >= rightMax) {
                    rightMax = height[right];
                } else {
                    trappedWater += rightMax - height[right];
                }
                right--;
            }
        }
        return trappedWater;
    }
}

📝 Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: O(n) (Single pass through the array)

Space Complexity: O(1) (Only a few extra variables are used)

📌 Topics Covered:

Two Pointer Approach

Array Manipulation

Water Trapping Concept

💡 Additional Notes:

This solution efficiently calculates the trapped rainwater without using extra space.

It ensures linear time complexity by using two pointers to traverse the array in one pass.
