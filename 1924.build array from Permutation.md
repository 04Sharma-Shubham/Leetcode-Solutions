## 📘 Problem: 1920. Build Array from Permutation

> **Difficulty**: Easy  
> [🔗 Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-array-from-permutation/)

### 🧠 Problem Statement:
Given a **zero-based permutation** `nums` (0-indexed), build an array `ans` of the same length where `ans[i] = nums[nums[i]]`, and return it.

---

### 💡 Example:
**Input:**  
`nums = [0,2,1,5,3,4]`  
**Output:**  
`[0,1,2,4,5,3]`

---

### ✅ Java Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] buildArray(int[] nums) {
        int i = nums.length;
        int[] ans = new int[i];
        for (int x = 0; x < i; x++) {
            ans[x] = nums[nums[x]];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
🛠️ How it Works:
Loop through the array nums.

For each index x, set ans[x] = nums[nums[x]].

This directly uses the permutation property where nums[i] is a valid index.
