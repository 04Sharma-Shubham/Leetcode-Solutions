# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions

## 🕵️‍♂️ 136. Single Number

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Language:** Java

---

### 📄 Problem Statement

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears **twice** except for **one**. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with **linear runtime complexity** and use **only constant extra space**.

### 🧪 Example

#### Input:
```java
nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
```
Output:
```
4
```
✅ Solution
```
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int num = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            num ^= n;
        }
        return num;
    }
}
```
⚙️ Approach
The XOR (^) operator is used to cancel out duplicate numbers.

XOR has the property that a ^ a = 0 and a ^ 0 = a.

So, as we iterate through the array and XOR all elements:

All duplicate elements cancel each other.

The unique one remains.

🧠 Time & Space Complexity
Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)
