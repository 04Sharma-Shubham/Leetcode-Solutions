# 💰 LeetCode 1672 — Richest Customer Wealth

## 💡 Problem Description

You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `i-th` customer has in the `j-th` bank.  
Return the **wealth** that the **richest customer** has.

A customer's wealth is the sum of money in all their bank accounts.  
The richest customer is the one with the **maximum wealth**.

## ✅ Approach

We:
- Iterate through each row (customer) in the 2D array.
- Calculate the sum of money across all banks for that customer.
- Track the maximum sum (wealth) encountered so far.

## 💻 Java Code
```
class Solution {
    public int maximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
        int richest = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int maxIndex = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for(int j = 0; j < accounts[i].length; j++) {
                sum += accounts[i][j];
            }
            if(sum > richest) {
                richest = sum;
                maxIndex = i;
            }
        }
        return richest;
    }
}

## 📊 Examples
```
Example 1:  
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]  
Output: 6  
Explanation:  
- 1st customer wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6  
- 2nd customer wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6  
- Maximum wealth = 6
```
```
Example 2:  
Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]  
Output: 10  
Explanation:  
- Customer 1 wealth = 6  
- Customer 2 wealth = 10  
- Customer 3 wealth = 8  
- Maximum wealth = 10
```

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity
```
**Time Complexity:** O(m × n)  
- Where `m` is number of customers and `n` is number of banks.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)  
- No extra space used apart from primitive variables.
