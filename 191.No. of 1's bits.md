🔢 Problem #191: Number of 1 Bits

🧠 Problem Statement

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

📥 Example
```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string has a total of three '1' bits.
```
✅ Java Solution
```
class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i)
            if (((n >> i) & 1) == 1)
                ++ans;
        return ans;
    }
}
```
⚙️ Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(1) — always runs 32 iterations (constant time)

Space Complexity: O(1) — uses constant extra space

📚 Topics Covered

Bit Manipulation

Hamming Weight

Binary Representation

🌟 Additional Notes

This solution uses bitwise right shift and bitwise AND to count set bits.

It is efficient and consistent across all 32-bit integers.
