# ➕ LeetCode 1822: Sign of the Product of an Array

## 📜 Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`.  
Return **the sign of the product** of all values in the array:

- `1` if the product is **positive**,
- `-1` if the product is **negative**,
- `0` if the product is **zero**.

> ⚡ Note: The actual product of the numbers may be too large, so you only need to know the **sign**!

---

## 🧠 Example

### Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,3,2,1] Output: 1 Explanation: The product is positive.


### Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5,0,2,-3] Output: 0 Explanation: The product is zero because of the 0 in the array.


### Example 3:
Input: nums = [-1,1,-1,1,-1] Output: -1 Explanation: The product is negative.



---

## ✅ Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

---

## 🧩 Approach

- Loop through each number in the array.
- If any number is **0**, return **0** immediately.
- If the number is **negative**, count how many negatives there are.
- After the loop:
  - If the count of negative numbers is **even**, the overall product is **positive** → return `1`.
  - Otherwise, the product is **negative** → return `-1`.

## 💻 Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int arraySign(int[] nums) {
        int negativeCounter = 0;
        int positiveCounter = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                return 0;
            }
            if (nums[i] < 0) {
                negativeCounter++;
            }
            if (nums[i] > 0) {
                positiveCounter++;
            }
        }
        
        if (negativeCounter % 2 == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
🏁 Dry Run Example
Input:


nums = [-2, 3, 4]
Steps:

-2 → Negative → negativeCounter = 1

3 → Positive → positiveCounter = 1

4 → Positive → positiveCounter = 2

Since negativeCounter = 1 (odd), product sign = -1.

🚀 Tip: Instead of calculating big numbers, sometimes it's smarter to just track signs! Save time and avoid overflow!
