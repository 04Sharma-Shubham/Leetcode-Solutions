## 🔍 2535. Difference Between Element Sum and Digit Sum of an Array

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Language:** Java

---

### 📄 Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.  
- The **element sum** is the sum of all the elements in `nums`.  
- The **digit sum** is the sum of all the digits of each element in `nums`.

Return the **absolute difference** between the element sum and the digit sum.

### 🧪 Example

#### Input:
```java
nums = [1, 15, 6, 3]
```
Output:
```
9
```
Explanation:
Element Sum = 1 + 15 + 6 + 3 = 25

Digit Sum = 1 + (1 + 5) + 6 + 3 = 16

Absolute Difference = |25 - 16| = 9

✅ Solution
```
class Solution {
    public int differenceOfSum(int[] nums) {
        int sum = 0;
        int digitSum = 0;

        for (int n : nums) {
            sum += n;
        }

        for (int x : nums) {
            while (x > 0) {
                digitSum += x % 10;
                x /= 10;
            }
        }

        return Math.abs(digitSum - sum);
    }
}
```
⚙️ Approach
Iterate over nums once to calculate the element sum.

Iterate again to break down each number and compute the digit sum.

Return the absolute difference between both sums.

🧠 Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n * d), where n is the number of elements and d is the number of digits per element.

Space Complexity: O(1)
