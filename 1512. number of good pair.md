## 🧠 Question 1512: Number of Good Pairs

### ✅ Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, a pair `(i, j)` is called a *good pair* if `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `i < j`.

Return the number of good pairs.

### 💡 Example

**Input:**
```
nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
```


**Output:**
```
4
```


**Explanation:**  
There are 4 good pairs: (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5)

### 🧪 Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int numIdenticalPairs(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        int[] cnt = new int[101];
        for (int x : nums) {
            ans += cnt[x]++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
🔍 Approach
We maintain a frequency count of elements using an integer array cnt[].

For each element in nums, the number of good pairs it forms is equal to how many times it has already appeared.

So for each x in nums, we add cnt[x] to our answer and then increment cnt[x].

⏱️ Time Complexity
O(n) – where n is the length of the input array.
