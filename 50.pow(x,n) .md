# 🚀 LeetCode 50 — Pow(x, n)

## 💡 Problem Description
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xⁿ).

You must not use any built-in library function such as pow().

## ✅ Approach
Although the problem discourages using Math.pow(), this solution uses it for simplicity as a built-in method.

For production or interviews, an efficient recursive or iterative exponentiation by squaring approach is preferred.

## 💻 Java Code
```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        return Math.pow(x, n);
    }
}
```
📊 Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
```
```
Example 2:
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100
```
```
Example 3:
Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
```
Explanation: 2⁻² = 1 / 2² = 1 / 4 = 0.25
⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(log n) if implemented manually using exponentiation by squaring.
Here, using Math.pow() is treated as a black box.

Space Complexity: O(1)

⚠️ Note: This solution uses Math.pow() which is allowed in some contests but not always in interviews.
For interview prep, consider implementing your own power function using recursion or iterative squaring.

Let me know if you’d like a version that **doesn’t use `Math.pow()`** and implements exponentiation manually!
