🔢 Problem 3110: Score of a String

📌 Problem Statement

Given a string s, the score of the string is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.

Your task is to compute the score of a given string s.

📝 Example

✅ Input:
```
s = "hello"
```
✅ Output:
```
13
```
✅ Explanation:
```
| ASCII Difference |
h(104) -> e(101) => |104 - 101| = 3
e(101) -> l(108) => |101 - 108| = 7
l(108) -> l(108) => |108 - 108| = 0
l(108) -> o(111) => |108 - 111| = 3
Total Score = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13
```
💻 Java Solution
```
class Solution {
    public int scoreOfString(String s) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            result += Math.abs(s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i - 1));
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
📊 Complexity Analysis

⏳ Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string, since we iterate through the string once.

🛠 Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

🔎 Key Takeaways

✅ Computes ASCII differences efficiently.✅ Works for both lowercase and uppercase letters.✅ Runs in linear time with constant space.

🎯 Optimized for fast execution and memory efficiency! 🚀
