Problem 3110: Score of a String

Problem Statement

Given a string s, the score of the string is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.

Write a function that computes the score of a given string s.

Example

Input:

s = "hello"

Output:

13

Explanation:

| ASCII Difference |
h(104) -> e(101) => |104 - 101| = 3
e(101) -> l(108) => |101 - 108| = 7
l(108) -> l(108) => |108 - 108| = 0
l(108) -> o(111) => |108 - 111| = 3
Total Score = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13

Java Solution

class Solution {
    public int scoreOfString(String s) {
        int result=0;
        for(int i=1;i<s.length();i++){
            result+=Math.abs(s.charAt(i)-s.charAt(i-1));
        }
        return result;
    }
}

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string, since we iterate through the string once.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

Notes

The function computes the ASCII difference of adjacent characters and sums them up.

Works efficiently for both lowercase and uppercase letters.
