# 🔄 LeetCode 3467 — Transform Array by Parity

## 💡 Problem Description
Given an integer array `nums`, transform it by:
- Changing every even number to `0`
- Changing every odd number to `1`  
Then sort the array in non-decreasing order.

Return the transformed array.

## ✅ Approach
We iterate through the array and:
- Replace even numbers (`nums[i] % 2 == 0`) with `0`
- Replace odd numbers with `1`

Then we sort the modified array using `Arrays.sort()`.

## 💻 Java Code
```
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] transformArray(int[] nums) {
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] % 2 == 0) {
                nums[i] = 0;
            } else {
                nums[i] = 1;
            }
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        return nums;
    }
}
```

## 📊 Examples
```
Example 1:  
Input: nums = [3, 2, 4, 1]  
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1]  
Explanation:  
- 2 and 4 become 0 (even)  
- 3 and 1 become 1 (odd)  
- Sorted result: [0, 0, 1, 1]

Example 2:  
Input: nums = [7, 5, 9]  
Output: [1, 1, 1]  
Explanation: All are odd numbers, transformed to 1 and already sorted.

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity
```
Time Complexity:  
- O(n log n): for sorting the array after transformation

Space Complexity:  
- O(1): in-place modification

📌 Tip: Since we only convert to 0s and 1s, sorting results in all 0s followed by 1s.
