# 📘 LeetCode 172 — Factorial Trailing Zeroes

## 💡 Problem Description

Given an integer `n`, return the number of **trailing zeroes** in `n!` (n factorial).

Trailing zeroes are the number of consecutive `0`s at the end of the factorial value.

## 🧠 Intuition

Trailing zeros in a factorial are created by the factors **2 × 5**.  
But in any factorial, there are always more 2s than 5s in the prime factors.  
So, we only need to count the number of **5s** contributed by factors of `n`.

---

## ✅ Approach

- Continuously divide `n` by 5 to count how many multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., are present.
- Add all of those up to get the total number of trailing zeroes.

## 💻 Java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        while (n > 0) {
            n /= 5;
            count += n;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120 → 1 trailing zero.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 30
Output: 7
Explanation: 30! has 7 trailing zeroes.

```

🔁 Note: The actual factorial value is not computed due to potential overflow. We only count the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.
