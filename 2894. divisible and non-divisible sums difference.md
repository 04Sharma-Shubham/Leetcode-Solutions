# ➗ LeetCode Problem 2894: Divisible and Non-Divisible Sum Difference

## 📘 Problem Statement

Given two integers `n` and `m`, return the **difference** between:

- The **sum of all positive integers ≤ `n` that are **not divisible** by `m`, and  
- The **sum of all positive integers ≤ `n` that **are divisible** by `m`.

In other words:  
`Difference = (Sum of non-divisible by m) - (Sum of divisible by m)`

---

## 🧠 Example

Input: n = 10, m = 3
Output: 19
Explanation:

Numbers not divisible by 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 → sum = 37

Numbers divisible by 3: 3, 6, 9 → sum = 18

Difference = 37 - 18 = 19


---

## ✅ Constraints

- `1 <= n, m <= 1000`

---

## 🧩 Approach

We iterate through all integers from `1` to `n`:
- If the number is **not divisible** by `m`, add it to `num1`.
- If the number **is divisible**, add it to `num2`.

Then return the difference: `num1 - num2`.

This simple loop-based approach is optimal for the given constraints.

## 💻 Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        int num1 = 0;
        int num2 = 0;
        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i % m != 0) {
                num1 += i;
            } else {
                num2 += i;
            }
        }
        diff = num1 - num2;
        return diff;
    }
}
```
