# 👥 LeetCode 3516: Find Closest Person

## 📜 Problem Statement

You are given three integers:

- `x` → position of the first person,
- `y` → position of the second person,
- `z` → position of the target.

You need to **find out**:

- Return `1` if the **first person** is closer to `z`.
- Return `2` if the **second person** is closer to `z`.
- Return `0` if **both are equally close**.

---

## 🧠 Example
```
### Example 1:
Input: x = 3, y = 7, z = 5 Output: 1 Explanation: Distance from x to z = 2, from y to z = 2 → equally close. Return 0.
```
```

### Example 2:
Input: x = 1, y = 4, z = 2 Output: 1 Explanation: Distance from x to z = 1, from y to z = 2. First person is closer.
```
```

### Example 3:
Input: x = 10, y = 2, z = 5 Output: 2 Explanation: Distance from x to z = 5, from y to z = 3. Second person is closer.
```

```

## ✅ Constraints

- `-10^9 <= x, y, z <= 10^9`

---
```
## 🧩 Approach

- Find the **absolute difference** between `x` and `z`, and between `y` and `z`.
- Compare:
  - If `diff1 < diff2`, first person is closer → return `1`.
  - If `diff1 > diff2`, second person is closer → return `2`.
  - If both are **equal**, return `0`.

✅ **Absolute difference** is used because distance cannot be negative.

## 💻 Java Solution

```java
class Solution { 
    public int findClosest(int x, int y, int z) {
        int diff1 = Math.abs(x - z);
        int diff2 = Math.abs(y - z);
        
        if (diff1 < diff2) {
            return 1;
        } else if (diff1 == diff2) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            return 2;
        }
    }
}
```
🏁 Dry Run Example
Input:

```
x = 8, y = 3, z = 5
Steps:

Distance from 8 to 5 = 3

Distance from 3 to 5 = 2

Second person is closer → return 2
```
