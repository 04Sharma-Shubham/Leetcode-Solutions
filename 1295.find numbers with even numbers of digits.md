## ✅ Approach
We check how many numbers in the array fall into digit ranges that are even:
- 10 to 99 (2 digits)
- 1000 to 9999 (4 digits)
- 100000 (6 digits)

This avoids converting numbers to strings.

## 💻 Java Code
```
class Solution {
    public int findNumbers(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 0;

        for (int num : nums)
            if (9 < num && num < 100 || 999 < num && num < 10000 || num == 100000)
                ++ans;

        return ans;
    }
}
```
