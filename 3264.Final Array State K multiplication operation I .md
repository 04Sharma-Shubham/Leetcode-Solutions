## 🔢 Problem 3264: Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations I

> **Difficulty**: Medium  
> [🔗 View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/final-array-state-after-k-multiplication-operations-i)

---

### 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`, an integer `k`, and a `multiplier`.  
Perform the following operation `k` times:

- Find the **smallest** element in the array and **multiply** it by `multiplier`.

Return the final state of the array after performing all operations.

---

### 💡 Example

**Input**:  
`nums = [1,2,3]`  
`k = 2`  
`multiplier = 3`

**Step-by-step**:
- First iteration: Multiply 1 → becomes 3 → array: [3,2,3]
- Second iteration: Multiply 2 → becomes 6 → array: [3,6,3]

**Output**:  
`[3,6,3]`

### ✅ Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] getFinalState(int[] nums, int k, int multiplier) {
        int n = nums.length;
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            int min = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) { 
                if (nums[i] < nums[min]) {
                    min = i;
                }
            }
            nums[min] *= multiplier;
        }
        return nums;
    }
}
```
⚙️ How It Works
For each of the k iterations:

Find the index of the minimum element.

Multiply that element by the given multiplier.

Return the modified array.

This approach ensures the lowest elements get multiplied first, allowing possible strategic maximization or transformation based on problem context.
