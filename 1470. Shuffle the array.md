## 🧩 Problem 1470: Shuffle the Array

> **Difficulty**: Easy  
> [🔗 LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-the-array/)

---

### 📝 Problem Statement:

Given the array `nums` consisting of `2n` elements in the form `[x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn]`, return the array in the form `[x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn]`.

---

### 📥 Example:
**Input:**  
`nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3`  
**Output:**  
`[2,3,5,4,1,7]`

---

### ✅ Java Solution:

```java
class Solution {
  public int[] shuffle(int[] nums, int n) {
    int[] ans = new int[2 * n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      ans[i * 2] = nums[i];
      ans[i * 2 + 1] = nums[i + n];
    }
    return ans;
  }
}
```
⚙️ How It Works:
Create a new array ans of size 2n.

Iterate over the first half of nums, and for each i, place:

nums[i] at even indices.

nums[i + n] at the next odd index.

This interleaves the two halves of the array.
