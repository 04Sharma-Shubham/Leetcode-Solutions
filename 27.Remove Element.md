Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository!  
This section contains the Java solution for **Problem 27: Remove Element**.

## 📘 Problem Statement

**Problem #27: Remove Element**

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

**Return** the new length of the array after removal.

Do not allocate extra space — perform this with **O(1)** extra memory.

---

## ✅ Solution

### 💡 Approach:

- We maintain a pointer `i` to track the position where the next valid (non-`val`) element should be placed.
- We loop through the array using an enhanced for-loop.
- Each time we find a number not equal to `val`, we copy it to the `i-th` position and increment `i`.
- Finally, we return `i` as the new length.

This approach ensures **in-place modification** and uses **constant extra space**.

### 🧾 Code (Java):

```java
class Solution {
  public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
    int i = 0;

    for (int num : nums)
      if (num != val)
        nums[i++] = num;

    return i;
  }
}
```
🧪 Example:
Input:

```
nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
```
Output:
```

Length after removal = 2
Modified nums = [2,2,_,_]
(The underscore _ indicates leftover values we don't care about.)
