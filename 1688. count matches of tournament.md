# 🏆 LeetCode 1688: Count of Matches in Tournament

## 📜 Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`, representing the number of teams in a tournament.

A tournament is played with the following rules:
- If the number of teams is **even**, each team is paired with another team. A total of `n / 2` matches are played, and `n / 2` teams advance to the next round.
- If the number of teams is **odd**, one team gets a **bye** (automatically advances), and the rest are paired. A total of `(n - 1) / 2` matches are played, and `(n - 1) / 2 + 1` teams advance.

Return the **total number of matches** played in the tournament until there is one winner.

## 🧠 Example

### Example 1:
Input: n = 7 Output: 6 Explanation:

Round 1: 3 matches, 1 team gets a bye → 4 teams advance

Round 2: 2 matches → 2 teams advance

Round 3: 1 match → 1 team wins Total matches = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6



### Example 2:
Input: n = 14 Output: 13 Explanation: Always n - 1 matches are played.


---

## ✅ Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 200`

---

## 🧩 Approach

- Every match reduces the number of teams by **exactly one**.
- Therefore, the **total number of matches** needed is simply `n - 1`.

✅ **Key Insight:** Whether the number of teams is even or odd, ultimately **n-1 matches** are needed to decide one winner.

---

## 💻 Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfMatches(int n) {
        return n - 1;
    }
}
```
🏁 Dry Run Example
Input:


n = 4
Steps:

4 teams → 2 matches → 2 teams advance

2 teams → 1 match → 1 winner

Total matches = 2 + 1 = 3 → 4 - 1 = 3 ✅
