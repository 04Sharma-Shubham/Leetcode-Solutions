**📝 Problem Statement:**  
Write a SQL query to report the name, population, and area of all the countries in the `World` table where:

- The area is greater than or equal to **3,000,000**, **OR**
- The population is greater than or equal to **25,000,000**

📂 **Table:** `World`  
📌 **Columns:** `name`, `population`, `area`

### ✅ Solution

```sql
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
```
🔍 Explanation:

The query selects the name, population, and area of countries that are either large in area or highly populated.

Using the OR condition ensures we capture both criteria.
