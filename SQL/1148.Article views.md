## 📌 Featured Problem

### 📰 1148. Article Views I

**📝 Problem Statement:**  
Write an SQL query to find all the authors who viewed their own articles.

📂 **Table:** `Views`  
📌 **Columns:**  
- `article_id`
- `author_id`
- `viewer_id`
- `view_date`

---

### ✅ Solution

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY 1;
```
🔍 Explanation:

We want to find authors who have viewed their own articles.

author_id = viewer_id ensures that the viewer is also the author.

DISTINCT removes duplicates if authors have viewed their own articles multiple times.

Results are sorted by id.
