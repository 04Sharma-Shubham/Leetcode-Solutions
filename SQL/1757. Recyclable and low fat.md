## 📌 Question 1757: Recyclable and Low Fat Products

**🟡 Difficulty:** Easy  
**🧠 Problem Link:** [LeetCode 1757](https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/)

---

### 🧾 Problem Description:

Write an SQL query to find the ids of products that are both **recyclable** and **low fat**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

---

### 📂 Table: `Products`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |

- `product_id` is the primary key.
- `low_fats` is an enum of type `('Y', 'N')`.
- `recyclable` is an enum of type `('Y', 'N')`.

---

### ✅ Solution

```sql
SELECT product_id 
FROM Products 
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```
📌 Output Example:
If the Products table is:
```
product_id	low_fats	recyclable
0	Y	N                     N
1	Y	Y                     Y
2	N	Y                     Y
3	Y	Y                     Y
```
Then the result should be:
```
product_id
1
3
```
💡 Explanation:
We simply filter the rows where both the low_fats and recyclable columns are 'Y'.
