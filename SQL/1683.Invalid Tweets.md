## 🚀 Featured Problem

### 🐦 1683. Invalid Tweets

**📝 Problem Statement:**  
Write an SQL query to find the IDs of tweets that are **invalid**. A tweet is invalid if the length of its content **exceeds 15 characters**.

📂 **Table:** `Tweets`  
📌 **Columns:**  
- `tweet_id` (int)
- `content` (varchar)

---

### ✅ Solution

```sql
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(content) > 15;
```
🔍 Explanation:

CHAR_LENGTH(content) is used to measure the number of characters in the content column.

The WHERE clause filters tweets where content exceeds 15 characters.

Only the tweet_id of such tweets is selected as the result.
