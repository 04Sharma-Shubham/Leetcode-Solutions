**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Language:** Java

### 📘 Problem Statement

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### 🧪 Example

#### Input:
```java
s = ['h','e','l','l','o']
```
Output:
```
['o','l','l','e','h']
```
✅ Solution
java
Copy
Edit
class Solution {
  public void reverseString(char[] s) {
    int l = 0;
    int r = s.length - 1;

    while (l < r) {
      char temp = s[l];
      s[l++] = s[r];
      s[r--] = temp;
    }
  }
}
```
🚀 Approach
Use two-pointer technique: one at the beginning (l) and one at the end (r).

Swap the characters at these positions while l < r.

Move the pointers inward after each swap.

This runs in O(n) time and O(1) space as required.
